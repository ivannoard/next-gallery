  "<p class='text-muted'>Hello, this is Ivan. So, this is my own gallery, which includes photography, another pastime of mine. I use the analog Fujica Flash AF Date camera that I purchased in the middle of August 2023. I&apos;ve used a DSLR camera in the past, but this is my first time using an analog camera. So take a look at my photos and enjoy. Oh, and I should mention that I&apos;ll also blog here about whatever I feel like writing about and highlight my other work as a <b class='text-highlight'>Frontend Developer</b>. You can reach me via my social media accounts, including Instagram, LinkedIn, or my email by going to the contact page, where I&apos;ve created a form that is directly connected to my email.</p>";
